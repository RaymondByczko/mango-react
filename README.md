Hi there!

This is very draft work on a React project, utilizing Browserify.  So far, this code does nothing
really useful; its just fun and exploration.  As I think of and refine a more concrete goal,
I'll leave notes here.

Here are some simple steps to get things going.

a) npm run buildm1
// This prepares the bundled artifact that is utilized by the relevant web page, page15.html.

b) php8.3 -S localhost <choose a port here>

c) localhost:port/page15.html

The React components will be rendered on the page presented!

My next step will be to arrange a REST call back to the server, when a button is clicked.
I want to see if the node code and browserify can handle this fine.  It should.

Sincerely yours!
